PAGE TITLE 2: Commercial Equipment Financing - $500,000 to $20,000,000
From 500k to $20MM- Financing built for Scale
One of the core strengths of Vista Pacific Capital is our ability to secure financing for middle- to
large-ticket equipment purchases — the kind many traditional banks are hesitant to approve.
We partner with lenders that specialize in high-dollar transactions and bring deep expertise in
structuring and packaging these deals. Our experience helps business owners confidently make
major investments that drive growth, expansion, and long-term success.
Program Highlights
 Financing from $500,000 to $20,000,000
 Terms from 36 to 84 months
 Approvals in as little as 2–3 business days

(Higher-ticket transactions typically approved within 5 business days)
 Pre-funding available to vendors on approved transactions
 Minimal upfront costs — as little as one advance payment due at closing
 Bank-level rates with more flexibility and speed than traditional institutions

Do you Qualify?
This program is best suited for companies that meet most of the following:
 At least 2–5 years in business
 Strong financials, typically with positive cash flow
 Demonstrated comparable borrowing history
 Clean business credit profile
 Clear business use for the equipment
Not a perfect fit?
Applicants that don’t meet all the above — such as newer businesses or those with negative
cash flow — may still be considered if there’s a strong compensating factor, such as:
 A clear and credible growth story
 High-net-worth guarantors
 Strong industry experience
 Ability to put significant money down or include collateral
